# OrientationPlugin for Cura 15.04

The orientation plugin is a simple wrapper around the Tweaker. It allows you to quickly calculate and apply the best printable orientation directly from Cura.

## How to use it:

Move both files into Cura/util/ and update the printableObject.py

The layflat function will be replaced by the Tweaker's Auto-Rotate.

Note that this patch is not officially.
